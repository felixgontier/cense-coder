It is recommended to discuss about noise annoying and loudness monitoring and evaluation with sensor network.

Is it possible to achieve a two channel coding and transmission with this proposed scheme?

Comments and Suggestions for Authors

The Introduction is a bit shaky and needs to be reworked in my opinion. This section should: a) provide a literature review of the state of the art on acoustic sensors’ networks; b) identify a methodological gap in current practice; c) explain why it is important to fill it; and d) give a glimpse about how the proposed research aimed to do so. The current structure is confusing to me, with Section 2 coming a bit out of the blue (I feel it should be reported earlier in the Introduction).

-> fuse intro en sec. 2 using the structure proposed by the reviewer.

Please, also note that not all readers are likely to be familiar with ASC and AED protocols, so it would be nice if the authors could provide some more details about the general steps; i.e., feature extraction (parametrisation) stage, classification stage, etc.

-> easy, diagrams

The Validation protocol (Section 4) is not very convincing. In particular, the subjective validation of Section 4.3 does not look rigorous at all.

-> répondre en re listant les elements de validation and for all of those required properties we designed a validation procedure. We acknowledge that the listening test is somewhat informal, as our goal is more to provide insights about why the transmitted data will not lead to intelligible speech content than to fully prove it which would be out of the scope of this paper.

In general, a strange aspect for me is that, this paper being submitted to the journal Sensors, there is no actual description of the sensors’ network architecture and/or hardware components proposed for the current study.

-> recadrer the contribution is about the definition of a coding scheme that will be used (as stated in the conclusion) in a sensor network. But prior to this usage, several properties needed to be validated, motivating this work.

The overall structure of the paper should be re-thought in my opinion, as the reader struggles to orientate himself between the different sections of the manuscript. When I read the conclusions, it is hard to track back the discourse in the methodological and results sections.

-> provide more references

It would be nice if the authors could add the following information to their work:

1. Motivation for using the third octave band spectral representation.

-> underline

2. Clearly state the novel points of this work in the introduction.

-> paragraph intro contributions

3. Why did you select these classification schemes? There many approaches in the literature exploiting that; for example "A novel holistic modeling approach for generalized sound recognition". In addition to that, the authors should justify why the did not employ deep learning (for both feature extraction and pattern recognition)

-> replication

4. Another point regarding detection would be to relate this work with other operating in real unrestricted environments, such as "Acoustic detection of human activities in natural environments" and how the proposed method could boost the existing ones.

- this would be a very interesting avenue of research that could be considered for future research. cite

5. Since the authors use the UrbanSound8k dataset, it is not clear how the sensor grid approach is applied. Is there a grid of sensors included?

-> replication reduire l'aed dans l'intro

6. The authors should compare their system with other existing in the related literature to understand its merits and limitations. This should be done in many levels, i.e. coding, recognition, detection, etc.

 -> contribution coding only and to the best of our knowledge the proposed approach is the only scheme where the data transmitted is not the detected events nor the raw audio but an intermediate spectral based format, specifically designed for acoustic monitoring and aed.

 This is is now more clearly stated in the x paragraph of the introduction.

7. Regarding intelligibility, it would be nice if the authors gave more information on the used metric. Moreover they should use standard metrics used for that which are similar to those used in the speech enhancement field. See paper "Objective comparison of speech enhancement algorithms under real world conditions" for more details.

-> motivate why the standard evaluation protocol itu does not fit (citer itu, paper) due to no modeling of background.

now more precisely explain the metrics and give insights
